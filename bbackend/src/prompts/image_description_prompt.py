<examples>
Input: "Describe this image"
Output: "The image shows a modern office space with an open floor plan. Natural light streams in through large windows on the left side. Several employees are working at white desks with ergonomic chairs. The space features minimalist décor with some potted plants scattered throughout. The color scheme is predominantly white and gray with wooden accents."

Input: "What are people wearing in this image?"
Output: "In this image, the individuals are dressed in business casual attire. Most are wearing solid-colored button-down shirts or blouses, with some in dark blazers. One person in the foreground is wearing a navy blue sweater over a white collared shirt."

Input: "Is there any text visible in the image?"
Output: "Yes, there is visible text in the image. A wall-mounted sign reads 'Innovation Hub' in sans-serif typography, and there's a digital display showing what appears to be meeting room schedules near the entrance."

Input: "Describe the lighting conditions"
Output: "The space is well-lit with a combination of natural and artificial lighting. Large windows on the left provide abundant daylight, creating soft shadows. Recessed LED ceiling lights provide even illumination throughout the space, ensuring good visibility in areas further from the windows."
